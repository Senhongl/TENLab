# TENLab

## Introduction
TENLab is an imperative language that supports distributed matrix calculation and its basic syntax is a combination of Python, Matlab and C. In TENLab, everything needs to be wrapped into a tensor, and that's the underlying philosophy of our language, which is to say. In addition to primitive data types, TENLab also provides an advanced data type, i.e., void tensor, which supports user defines and implements some complex data structure.  TENLab also provides an abstract wrapper for users to define their own distributed model for matrix computation. Ideally, TENLab also provides an underlying distributed model for matrix addition, subtraction and multiplication. Overall, the goal is to create a language that is as convenient as Python but supports a parallel matrix computation for acceleration.
